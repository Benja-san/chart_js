# ChartJs x NextJs
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`], its purpose is to discover the chartJs library and to implement it.
I made this repository as a public one for you to download and try the chart.js lib in a Next app environment as much as you want
