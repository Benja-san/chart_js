# ChartJs x NextJs
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`], its purpose is to discover the chartJs library and to implement it.
I made this repository as a public one for you to download and try the chart.js lib in a Next app environment as much as you want
You can refer to [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) and [Chart-React-Js-2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2) to discover Chart documentation
This little project is using css modules, you can learn more about this going to [this link](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support) and for simplified styling I'm using [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) library
All necessary libs are implemented in the package, you just have to type the install command with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
